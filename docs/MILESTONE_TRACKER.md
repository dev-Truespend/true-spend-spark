| Priority | Blocker | What's Missing | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 P0 | **Stripe subscription billing** | 3 Edge Functions + gating | No revenue at all |
| 🟠 P1 | **Plaid webhook hardening** | JWT verify + REMOVED/PENDING→POSTED | Data integrity risk |
| 🟠 P1 | **`bff-transactions` Edge Function** | Missing BFF endpoint | Frontend calls Supabase directly |
| 🟠 P1 | **UserDashboard real data** | `$0.00` hardcoded | Misleading user-facing metric |
| 🟡 P2 | Extension build pipeline | No Vite config for extension | Extension not publishable |
| 🟡 P2 | iOS / Android on-device builds | Folders exist, builds unverified | Apps not in stores |
| 🟡 P2 | Cloudflare full WAF + cache rules | Partial setup | CDN not fully optimised |

### 🟡 Phase 5 — BFF, AI & Rules Engine
**Weeks 20–24 · 75% Complete · In Progress**

> **Code audit finding:** `bff-transactions` Edge Function does NOT exist. Frontend calls Supabase directly for transactions. Only `bff-dashboard` and `location-analytics-bff` are implemented BFF endpoints.

| Week | Milestone | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 20 | `bff-dashboard` Edge Function (Redis cached) | ✅ Done | `supabase/functions/bff-dashboard/` (Upstash Redis) |

| Week 24 | `plaid-exchange-token` Edge Function | ✅ Done | `supabase/functions/plaid-exchange-token/` |
| **Missing** | **`bff-transactions` Edge Function** | ❌ Not built | Frontend calls Supabase REST directly |
| **Missing** | **`bff-insights`, `bff-budgets`, `bff-geofences` endpoints** | ❌ Not built | No BFF layer for these |
| **Gate** | **All BFF endpoints live; Plaid exchange working** | 🟡 Partial | bff-dashboard ✅, bff-transactions ❌ |

---

### 🟡 Phase 6 — Payment Integration ⚠️ REVENUE BLOCKER
**Weeks 25–29 · 50% Complete · In Progress**

> **Code audit finding:** Plaid sync IS substantially implemented — `webhook-plaid` handles `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` and upserts transactions via `/transactions/sync`. However, JWT signature verification is incomplete (header is checked but not cryptographically verified), `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED` soft-delete is not implemented, and `PENDING→POSTED` transitions are not handled. Stripe is 0% — no Edge Functions, no billing UI, no subscription gating exist anywhere in the codebase.

| Week | Milestone | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 25 | Plaid Link UI component (`react-plaid-link`) | ✅ Done | `src/features/credit-cards/hooks/usePlaid.tsx` |

| Week 26 | `webhook-plaid` Edge Function — receive + route events | ✅ Done | `supabase/functions/webhook-plaid/` |
| Week 26 | `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` → `/transactions/sync` → upsert | ✅ Done | Inside `webhook-plaid` |
| Week 26 | `plaid-sync-transactions` manual sync function | ✅ Done | `supabase/functions/plaid-sync-transactions/` |
| **Week 26** | **Plaid webhook JWT signature verification** | ❌ Incomplete | Header checked, not cryptographically verified |
| **Week 27** | **`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED` → soft-delete in DB** | ❌ Not done | Logs count, no DB write |
| **Week 27** | **`PENDING → POSTED` status transition** | ❌ Not done | Not handled |
| **Week 28** | **Stripe: `stripe-create-checkout-session` Edge Function** | ❌ Not started | No file exists |
| **Week 28** | **Stripe: `stripe-create-portal-session` Edge Function** | ❌ Not started | No file exists |
| **Week 29** | **Stripe: `stripe-webhook` Edge Function** | ❌ Not started | No file exists |
| **Week 29** | **Subscription gating in `ProtectedRoute`** | ❌ Not done | `src/integrations/stripe/index.ts` is a stub |
| **Week 29** | **Billing UI (plan selector, invoices)** | ❌ Not done | No billing page exists |
| **Gate** | **User links bank → transactions sync → Stripe charges** | 🔴 Not passed | Stripe = 0% |

---

### 🟡 Phase 11 — Browser Extension
**Weeks 46–47 · 55% Complete · In Progress**

> **Code audit finding:** The merchant detector content script IS fully implemented (was incorrectly reported as ❌). The options page has working settings toggles with `chrome.storage.sync`. The popup is wired to Supabase for budget queries (but spending always shows $0 — hardcoded). What's still missing: the one-click expense capture form, options OAuth account connect, and the extension build pipeline.

### 🟡 Phase 12 — Native Apps (iOS & Android)
**Weeks 48–49 · 35% Complete · In Progress**

> **Code audit finding:** Both `ios/` and `android/` native project folders exist — `cap add ios` and `cap add android` have been run. `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services.json` are present. The Capacitor config is production-configured (`appId: ai.truespend.app`, HTTPS only). However, no verified on-device builds, no splash screens, no app store submissions.

> **Code audit finding:** All UI components and Edge Functions for ML infrastructure exist. HuggingFace client is implemented (`src/features/ml/services/huggingface/`). `modal-training-trigger` and `modal-training-callback` Edge Functions are built.

### ❌ Phase 15 — Advanced ML Models
**Post-Week 51 · 0% functional · UI scaffolds exist**

> UI components exist for all Phase 15 models (renamed during cleanup for production readability). These are React dashboards — the underlying ML models have not been trained or deployed.

## Current Priorities (P0 → P3)

### 🔴 P0 — Cannot ship without

- [ ] **Stripe: `stripe-create-checkout-session` Edge Function**
- [ ] **Stripe: `stripe-webhook` Edge Function (subscription lifecycle)**
- [ ] **Stripe: `stripe-create-portal-session` Edge Function**
- [ ] **Subscription gating in `ProtectedRoute`** (free vs. paid)
- [ ] **Billing UI** (plan selector, current plan, invoice history)
- [ ] **`bff-transactions` Edge Function** (currently bypassed)
- [ ] **Sentry error monitoring** (can't diagnose production issues without it)
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** (lint → test → build → deploy on merge)
- [ ] **Unit + integration tests on critical paths**

### 🟠 P1 — First sprint after launch

- [ ] **Plaid webhook JWT signature verification** (security gap)
- [ ] **`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED` soft-delete** in webhook-plaid
- [ ] **`PENDING → POSTED` transition** in webhook-plaid
- [ ] **UserDashboard real data** — replace hardcoded `$0.00` with real Supabase query
- [ ] **Extension popup: budget spending calculation** (currently always $0)
- [ ] **Extension popup: one-click expense capture form**
- [ ] **Extension build pipeline** (separate Vite config for `extension/`)
- [ ] **Cloudflare full WAF + cache rules**

### 🟡 P2 — First month post-launch

- [ ] iOS: `npx cap sync` + Xcode on-device build verified
- [ ] Android: Gradle on-device build verified
- [ ] Native splash screen + app icons (all resolutions)
- [ ] Deep-link handling (email verify, OAuth callback in app)
- [ ] Mobile E2E test run (iOS + Android)
- [ ] Options page: OAuth account connect flow
- [ ] GraphQL gateway (N+1 query elimination)
- [ ] Receipt OCR fallback chain (Google Vision → HuggingFace → manual)
- [ ] RLS edge-case audit
- [ ] Security penetration test
- [ ] Lazy-loading for internal/admin pages (reduce 3.2 MB bundle)

### 🔵 P3 — Post-launch backlog

- [ ] Biometric auth (Face ID / Fingerprint) via Capacitor plugin
- [ ] iOS TestFlight + Android Play Store internal track
- [ ] Train first ML model end-to-end (transaction categoriser)
- [ ] Model canary deployment (10% traffic split)
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] CSV transaction import
- [ ] Shared budgets (household mode)
- [ ] AI natural-language query interface
- [ ] Dark / light mode persistence

## Upcoming Integrations

| Integration | Stub Location | What's Needed |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe** | `src/integrations/stripe/index.ts` | 3 Edge Functions + `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` |
| **Google Maps** | `src/integrations/google-maps/index.ts` | Maps JS key + `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` (Edge Fns already exist) |
| **Foursquare** | `supabase/functions/foursquare-*/` (5 functions exist) | Frontend integration + API key |
| **Plaid hardening** | `supabase/functions/webhook-plaid/` | JWT verify + REMOVED/PENDING→POSTED |

> Note: Google Maps Edge Functions (`google-maps-geocode`, `google-maps-autocomplete`, `google-maps-directions`, `google-places-details`) already exist. Only the frontend integration needs the JS API key.
